# ValorOnly

Play as Valor Form the whole time. (Except Pride Lands and Atlantica)

Currently you crash if you change Soras Primary Keyblade. (Don't do that unless in Pride Lands or Atlantica where you are not Valor Form Sora. A forced menu also lets you change it.)

You must either start a New Game or load a save where you have obtained all forms to prevent crashing due to forms missing Keyblades.

You have Max Level growth of other forms if starting a new game except dodge roll. If you do not want to have this open the mod.yml in a text editor and scroll down to the bottom where it says `#Delete everything below if you dont want growth from other forms` and delete everything below this line before starting a new game.
