# ValorOnly

Play as Valor Form the whole time. (Except Pride Lands and Atlantica)

Currently you crash if you change Soras primary keyblade. (Don't do that unless in Pride Lands or Atlantica where you are not Valor Form Sora. A forced menu also lets you change it.)

You must either start a New Game or load a save where you have obtained all forms to prevent crashing due to forms missing keyblades.
