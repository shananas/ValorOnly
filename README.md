# ValorOnly

Play as Valor Form the whole time. (Except PL and Atlantica for now)

Currently you crash if you change Soras primary keyblade (Don't do that unless in PL or Atlantica where you are not Valor Form Sora)

You must either start a New Game or load a save where you have obtained all forms to prevent crashing due to forms missing keyblades.
